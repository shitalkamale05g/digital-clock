## 🕒 Digital Clock – Client Requirements

### 📋 General Requirements
- The application should display the **current time** in **HH:MM:SS** format.
- Support for **12-hour** and **24-hour** formats.

### 🛠️ Backend Requirements (if applicable)
> Note: A basic digital clock may not need a backend, but if extended features are required, here's what the backend might handle:

- **Time zone management**: Fetch accurate time based on selected zone.
- **User preferences**: Save format, theme, and time zone settings.
- **Authentication** (optional): Allow users to log in and save settings.
- **API integration**:
  - World Clock API for accurate time zone data.
  - Geo-location API for auto-detecting user time zone.
- **Database** (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL):
  - Store user settings and preferences.
- **Server-side language**: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or PHP.
